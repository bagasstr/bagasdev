## 🛠️ New Developer Tools

### Performance Analysis Scripts
```bash
npm run analyze     # Generate bundle analysis report
npm run size        # Analyze build output sizes  
npm run audit       # Security and dependency audit
npm run update-deps # Update dependencies safely
```

### Monitoring Capabilities
- Bundle size tracking
- Performance metrics monitoring  
- Core Web Vitals preparation
- Error tracking and logging

## 🎛️ Configuration Files Updated

### Enhanced Files
- ✅ `next.config.mjs` - Complete performance configuration
- ✅ `src/app/layout.tsx` - Optimized loading and metadata
- ✅ `src/lib/utils.ts` - Caching and error handling
- ✅ `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Memoization and optimization
- ✅ `src/app/globals.css` - Performance CSS optimizations
- ✅ `package.json` - Analysis tools and scripts

### New Files Created
